This Go installation is managed by Ansible role alexdzyoba.golang - 
https://github.com/alexdzyoba/ansible-golang.

This file is needed to avoid unnecessary overwriting of go toolchain files on
each run of this role, so making it idempotent.

You can delete this file, but next time you run the role files will be
overwritten.
